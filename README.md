# A network of molecular and functional interactions for multi-omics data analysis

We developed a network of molecular and functional interactions to analyse gene-related, metabolite-related and microbiota species-related input scores derived from multi-omics datasets.
The molecular and functional interactions are derived from STRING (gene-gene interactions), STITCH (gene-metabolite), HBNet (human-bacterial gene-gene interactions) and GEMMA project datasets (metabolite-metagenomic species interactions). All features are mapped to their standard identifiers from NCBI Entrez Gene ID, NCBI PubChem CID, KEGG COMPOUND ID, ChEBI ID and metagenomic species pan-genome MSP ID.

This dataset is part of the [GEMMA Project Multi-Omics Toolbox](https://www.gemma-project.eu/toolbox)

Release: with the publication of articles by the GEMMA Consortium.
